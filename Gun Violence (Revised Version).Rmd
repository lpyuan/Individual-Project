## 1. Project Introduction

America is an exceptional country when it comes to guns. In this project, we will focus on this unique topic -  gun violence and explain interesting findings by data visualization.

Inspired by a Vox [article](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/10/2/16399418/us-gun-violence-statistics-maps-charts) titled "America's unique gun violence problem, explained in 17 maps and charts", we developed the following two data products including a redesign of existing data product and a deceptive data product. Comparing three versions of charts together, it indeed can sharpen our critical perspectives on data visualizations,logical reasoning about design decisions, and efforts on data visualization skiis improvement. 


## 2. Data Source and Wranging

The data uesd in this projects are generated mainly from the following public data sources:

+ Mass Shootings Data: [Gun Violence Archive](http://www.shootingtracker.com/)
+ Gun Law Strength Data: [The Giffords Law Center](http://lawcenter.giffords.org/scorecard/)
+ Multiple Cause of Death Data: [CDC](https://wonder.cdc.gov/mcd.html).
  (The data represented firearm caused death in each state each year, from 1999 to 2016.)
+ [Gun Ownership and Social Gun Culture Data](http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc4809774)

Here is the data clean and aggregation part in jupyter file:

## 3. Redesign Data Product

### 3.1 Fewer People Die From Gun Violence In States With Stronger Gun Laws.

Revised Version:[Tableau Public Link](https://public.tableau.com/profile/lipin.yuan#!/vizhome/GunControlvs_GunDeathByState2017/Sheet4?publish=yes)

When it comes to gun control vs gun deaths, the original article used one parameter that states with at least one firearm law designed to protect children in place to explain if the state have tighter gun control from the data in 2007. But i think this might not be enough to evaluate specific differences between states on how strong their gun control is. And there should be more parameters to compare states in the form of ranking or grading. 

In the first version, I used the Giffords Law Center ranking data of all states from six perspectives including Background Checks, Child Access Prevention, Concealed Carry Permitting, Domestic Violence, Extreme Risk Protection Order and Military-style Weaponry. 

And the first version chart is about the correlation between gun law strength ranking and gun death rate ranking. Although these two ranking has the same range from 0 to 50, they have different meaning. For gun law strength ranking, the higher rank ( close to 1) means strong control in the good way, but for gun death rate rank, the higher rank (close to 1) means more death in the bad way. It might be anti-intuitive and easy to make mistake.

So from the perspective of audience reading this article in Vox, the chart should be direct and easy for them to see the correlation and could persuade them in a clear way. Thus, in the revised version, i changed the gun death rate rank to gun death rate, and the audience can clearly understand that the lower gun law ranking leader to bigger gun death rate. Meanwhile, I added two averaged line to help audience to locate each state quickly in case they might be lost in the scattering circles. 


### 3.2 States With More Guns Don’t Necessarily Tend To Have More Gun Deaths.

Original Chart | First Version 
-------------  | ------------- 
![](https://github.com/lpyuan/AddPics/blob/master/GunDeath.png) | ![](https://github.com/lpyuan/AddPics/blob/master/GunOwnership_Deaths.png)|
[Original Chart Link](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/10/2/16399418/us-gun-violence-statistics-maps-charts) | First Version: [Tableau Public Link](https://public.tableau.com/profile/lipin.yuan#!/vizhome/GunOwnershipvs_GunDeaths2017/GunOwnership?publish=yes)|

Revised Version|
-------------  | 
![](https://github.com/lpyuan/AddPics/blob/master/Gun_Ownership_Death.png) |
Revised Version: [Tableau Public Link](https://public.tableau.com/profile/lipin.yuan#!/vizhome/GunOwnershipvs_GunDeathByState2013/Sheet7?publish=yes) 

In the original article, the author cited the above original chart to present the relationship between gun ownership and gun deaths, which is that states with more guns tend to have far more gun deaths, including homicides and suicides. And the conclusion is made from data in 2013. 

But when I reviewed the explanation in the article and found a big difference that the author used gun deaths in the chart but only said "more guns in a community leads to more homicide deaths”. Since gun deaths are a combined measure of gun homicides and gun suicides, so if we only use gun deaths to represent homicide deaths and suicide deaths, it means that we overlooked the possibility that these two could have different correlation with gun ownership.

For my first version, I didn’t notice this problem and also used the gun deaths as Y-axis and updated the civilian owned guns(per 100) data in 2017 as X-axis. Then the chart has the same increasing trending line but most of the states aggregated in the range of 0 to 5 of X-axis. And because of the outlier( WY state), it could not give more details of other states. 

After we learned the six principles of Analytic Design, I realized that I should show the comparison and analyzed the relationship of gun ownership with two variables separately including homicide and suicide. To my surprise, the revised version tells a totally different story: the relationship between gun ownership and homicide is weak (and appears negative), the relationship between gun ownership and suicide is strong and positive. Therefore, the positive relationship in the original chart is due to gun suicides, it might not imply conclusions about gun homicides.  So the revised version contrasts the difference between homicide and suicide and give more reasonable evidence to make conclusions.

### 3.3 Number of Mass Shootings Incidents Declined but Total Casualty Keeps Increasing.

First Version-1: [Tableau Public Link](https://public.tableau.com/profile/lipin.yuan#!/vizhome/MassShootings2014-2018/MassShooting?publish=yes) | First Version-2: [Tableau Public Link](https://public.tableau.com/profile/lipin.yuan#!/vizhome/MassShootingsStatistics2014-2018_05/NumMassShootings?publish=yes) |

Revised Version| 
-------------  | 
![](https://github.com/lpyuan/AddPics/blob/master/Revise_Num_Mass_Shootings.png) |
Revised Version: [Tableau Public Link](https://public.tableau.com/profile/lipin.yuan#!/vizhome/MassShootingsByYear2013-2017/NumMassShootings?publish=yes)

In this article, the author mentioned there had been more than 1,600 mass shootings since Sandy Hook in 2012 but didn’t provide any more details. Since he calculated data of several years, I think it will be better to visualize them in each year and find the trend. So from Gun Violence Archive, we can found mass shooting lists from January, 2013 to May, 2018.

In the first version, I plotted two charts including one map and one statistic bar chart. For the map, I added a population layer and then highlight the incidents areas in different states. Moreover,I used different circle sizes to represent the number of injured and killed people of each mass shooting incident. And then we can see the mass shootings happened more intensively in areas of larger population along western and eastern coast. The second bar chart try to give a more statistical explanation of mass shooting. But I put killed, injured, killed & injured together with the number of incidents together, it is hard to compare and emphasize the highlight to approve the finding.

Therefore, in the revised version, I deleted the map chart which might not be directly related to my finding and used one line chart because of the rule of data pixel ratio (data-ink ratio). In one word, it reminds me that less is more. And Tufte also [asserts](https://www.darkhorseanalytics.com/blog/data-looks-better-naked) that in displaying data we should remove all non-data-ink and redundant data-ink, within reason, to increase the data-ink-ratio and create a sound graphical design. So firstly, since 2018 didn’t have the whole year, so I decide to only compare data of 2013 to 2017. Secondly,I only selected two variables instead of four to present their different trending. The green line shows the increasing casualties from 2013 to 2017 and the gray line explains the decreasing number of incidents. In this way, it better illustrates the finding that the total number incidents decreased since 2016, while the number of casualty keeps increasing especially in 2017.

## 4. Deceptive Data Product

From the seventeen charts listed in the article, I chose three of them and used different data distortion techniques including inversted Y-axis, truncted X-axis and improper scaling presenting the data in an opposite way.

### 4.1 States with more guns have more gun deaths?

Original Chart | First Deceptive
-------------  | -------------
![](https://github.com/lpyuan/AddPics/blob/master/GunDeath.png)|![](https://github.com/lpyuan/AddPics/blob/master/Gun%20Ownership.png)
[Original Chart Link](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/10/2/16399418/us-gun-violence-statistics-maps-charts) | First Deceptive: [Tableau Public Link](https://public.tableau.com/profile/lipin.yuan#!/vizhome/GunOwnershipvs_GunDeaths_Deceptive/Sheet3?publish=yes)|

Revised Version|
-------------  |
![](https://github.com/lpyuan/AddPics/blob/master/Ownership_Deceptive.png)|
Revised Version: [Tableau Public Link](https://public.tableau.com/profile/lipin.yuan#!/vizhome/GunOwnershipvs_GunDeathsByState2013-Deceptive_2/Sheet8?publish=yes)

From the original chart on the left, the article illustrates that states with more guns tend to have far more gun deaths, including homicides and suicides, though there are several outliers. And the increasing trending line also seems t to strenghthen this opinion. 

In the first version, when we invert the rate of death per 10,000, the chart would be presented in an opposite way,which is exactly on the right. Using the same data in 2013 from a study in Injury Prevention and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention(CDC), the trending line become downward but actually represents increasing. If readers still explain this chart from a normal understanding of axis meaning, then it might mislead the conclusion to be *"more gunownership, less death rate"*. 

But the first version use a rather obviously deceptive technique, so for the revised version, I decided to use the number of gun deaths instead of gun death rate per 100,000 as Y-axis. Just as the chart shows, although we didn't convert Y-aixs, the result still became totally opposite compared to the original chart. 

### 4.2 Gun homicides have declined over the past couple decades?

Original Chart | Deceptive Chart
-------------  | -------------
![](https://github.com/lpyuan/AddPics/blob/master/rate_of_firearms.png)|![](https://github.com/lpyuan/AddPics/blob/master/Rate_of_deaths.png)
[Original Chart Link](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/10/2/16399418/us-gun-violence-statistics-maps-charts) | First Deceptive: [Tableau Public Link](https://public.tableau.com/profile/lipin.yuan#!/vizhome/RateofFirearmHomicideDeaths1999-2016/Dashboard1?publish=yes)|

Revised Version|
-------------  | 
![](https://github.com/lpyuan/AddPics/blob/master/Rate_Homicide_Deceptive_2.png) |
Revised Version: [Tableau Public Link](https://public.tableau.com/profile/lipin.yuan#!/vizhome/RateofFirearmHomicideDeaths_Deceptive_2/Sheet1?publish=yes)

The article argued that gun homicides have declined over the past couple decades. And from the original chart on the left, we can see from 1981 to 2010, the rate of firearm homicide deaths indeed has two sudden decreases. It also shows the decreasing trend, especially the maximum value around 1993 was 7.0, but in 2010 this value became the minimum 3.6. 

In the first version,if we only choose the data from 1999 to 2010 and also add some recent years data,the result can be completely different. Just as the deceptive chart shows, it seems that gun homicides (like all homicides) keep stable for years and even starts increasing from 2014 to 2016. Because we manipulated the starting data point and only present the stable period, then the conclusion became totally opposite by the truncated axis visual distortion.

While for the revised version, I shinked the Y-axis range from 0-8 to 2-5. In this way the trend seems fluctuated remarkably, which might seem to be similiar with the original chart. It can be deceptively tell that the trend of gun death rate of homicides goes up and down, just like the original chart but had a totally different increasing trend from 3.5 in 2014 to 4.5 in 2016.

### 4.3 Most gun deaths are not suicides?

Original Chart | First Deceptive 
-------------  | -------------
![](https://github.com/lpyuan/AddPics/blob/master/firearm_suicide_homicide.png)|![](https://github.com/lpyuan/AddPics/blob/master/Firearm_suicide.png)
[Original Chart Link](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/10/2/16399418/us-gun-violence-statistics-maps-charts) | First Deceptive: [Tableau Public Link](https://public.tableau.com/profile/lipin.yuan#!/vizhome/FirearmSuicidevs_Homicide_2/Sheet2?publish=yes)|

Revised Version|
-------------  | 
![](https://github.com/lpyuan/AddPics/blob/master/H&S.png) |
Revised Version: [Tableau Public Link](https://public.tableau.com/profile/lipin.yuan#!/vizhome/FirearmSuicidevs_Homicide1999-2016-Deceptive_2/Sheet2?publish=yes)

The author held the opinion that the majority of gun-related deaths in the US are suicides. And from the original graph we can obviously see that the darker color line representing suicide is on the upper part for the whole period and ended with a big increase than the homicide line.

In the first version,if we use a distorted area chart instead of lines together with a truncted Y-axis, then it could be visually deceptive and might mislead readers to make the conclusion that the firearm homicides are more than suicides. Because the deceptive chart started the death number from 15k, which intentionally dimished the suicide area size with an improper scaling. And when we just compared the area size of these two, the visual effect would lead to a mistake.

For the revised version, I changed the colors from two similiar ones to two strongly comparative ones to firstly present a visual impact. And instead of showing filters on the top right which might hard to see clearly, I highlight these two variables names onto the area. In this way, it might better to leave a deceptive impression.

## 5. Summary and Outlook

Data visualization is about communicating an idea that will drive action. Understanding the criteria for information to provide valuable insights and the reasoning behind constructing data visualizations will help us do that with efficiency and impact. 

During this course, I created two redesign and deceptive data products step by step. On one hand, I learned and applied important concepts including analytic design,argument model,metrics, audience,situational awareness,and the data pixel ratio. 

On the other hand, I sharpened my kills to try different deception techniques like misusing the dual-axis,omitting data and ignoring conventions. In this way, I can have a full understanding of what deceptive visualizations are and how much of an impact they can have. Then it will remind me of avoding making these mistakes.

In the future, technichally, I think I might finish all the tableau training videos and find insights from several different datasets and try redesign which is a really good way to exercise data visualization skills. More importanly, I think how to develop a rational logic to tell a persuasive story is a long way to go.
