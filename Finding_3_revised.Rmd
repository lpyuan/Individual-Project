## 1. Project Introduction

### Area of Interest

In this summer, the FIFA World Cup is scheduled to take place in Russia from June 14 to July 15. The competition has been played every four years since the inaugural tournament in 1930, except in 1942 and 1946 when it was not held because of the Second World War. It is the biggest single-event sporting competition in the world and is contested by the senior men's national teams from the 208 Member Associations of FIFA. 

The current format of the tournament involves 32 teams competing for the title at venues within the host nation(s) over a period of one month – this phase is often called the Final Competition.A qualification phase, the Preliminary Competition which currently takes place over the preceding three years, is used to determine which teams qualify for the tournament together with the host nation(s).

There are two hundred and eleven nations who can qualify for the World Cup, but only thirty-two teams actually make it. In order to qualify for the World Cup, the countries play matches against other countries in their region and depending on how many countries are in the region, only a handful can qualify. These matches take place across the time frame of 4 years, with athletes leaving their teams for a couple weeks to play with their national team.

### Importance of FIFA World Cup

The FIFA world cup is arguably the biggest sporting event in the world, with soccer/football fans being the majority on every continent except North America and Antarctica. It is the most prestigious and important trophy in the sport of football. 

According to FIFA official website, the FIFA World Cup is the world's most widely viewed sporting event; an estimated 715.1 million people watched the final match of the 2006 FIFA World Cup held in Germany and the 2010 event in South Africa was broadcast to 204 countries on 245 different channels. Inside the stadiums, a total of 3,170,856 spectators attended the 64 matches an average of 49,670 per match and the third highest aggregate attendance behind USA 1994 and Germany 2006.

There were also over six million people who attended public viewing events in 16 sites across the world: ten within South Africa and a further six across the globe in Rome, Paris, Berlin, Sydney, Mexico City and Rio de Janeiro. A total of 350,000 fans attended the International FIFA Fan Fest in Berlin for the semi-final match between Germany and Spain.

More importantly, it acts as a massive promotion for the game of football and for the host nation(s) and are therefore wonderful opportunities to help promote values of respect, fair play and discipline to the watching world.

## 3. Revised Data Product

### Finding 3.1

### Finding 3.2 

### Finding 3.3 - Does World Cup Really Bring Tourism Gains To Host Countries?

While many factors influence tourism growth, one of the more perceptible contributions e at least, in the public eye, comes from global events, or mega-events.

Mega-events, according to Roche (2000), are large-scale cultural (including commercial and sporting) events, which have a dramatic character, mass popular appeal and international significance. Obviously, FIFA World Cup is a precious opportunity for host countries to attract international tourists and increase their expenditure.

Firstly, according to one study, it is said that a very direct benefit of such mega-events on tourism is the increase of the number of tourists arrivals to the host country in the year of the event.

So we plot six host countries data of number of arrivals from 1995 to 2016. In this way, we can also measure the long-run impact on tourist arrivals, both before and after the event. For each country, we label out their host year with country name and the number of arrivals. 

For revised version, since we have two charts separately divided countries into two groups, so in Figure 1.1, we specifically highlight France (blue color) and Germany (orange color). Besides, we labeled their host year data for comparison. In this way, we changed the number of colors from six to two. Because after presentation, some of our audience suggested that multiple colors and labels may hide main information that we want to express.

Now from the revised chart above, we can more clearly see that the international tourists to France and Germany are obviously two biggest countries whose international tourists increase after hosting World Cup, especially in the following two years.  

In revised version of Figure 1.2, after we filter out France and Germany, we can have a better observation of other countries. Although South Africa and Japan is increasing, the growth rate is pretty small. It did not show an substantially arising trend around the host year. Meanwhile, I find that Brazil and Korea are two countries showing different decreasing trends from other two in the year after hosting World Cup.  This also help us to dig more on the reason why these two countries were negatively impacted. 

After our research, on general, maybe because 'regular' tourists change their behaviors when a mega-event is held, either shifting their trip to a different time or different location. This may result in reduced tourism gain, or even loss. For Brazil and Korea, because of their political scandal and cheating scandal, international media did much negative reports on these two countries and thus instead bring some damages to their national image which may harm their tourism.

As we cannot analysis many patterns of the number of international tourists, we tried to dig more in the following graph with the expenditure of international tourism.

#### <2> International Tourism Expenditures

[Revised Tableau Link](https://public.tableau.com/profile/lipin.yuan#!/vizhome/InternationalTourismExpenditure1995-2016_revised/Dashboard1?publish=yes)

From the aspect of tourism expenditure, when countries host global events, the assumption is often that the exposure and the tourism will massively boost. So far that does seem to be the case for Japan. But France, Germany, Korea and South Africa are all showing a very profitable growth.

In the original chart,since our data starts from 1995 to 2016, so we use time series data as rows and label their hosting data with annotation. But from this chart, we can only see each country’s trending and is not convenient to put these countries to the same time points.

For revised version, we changed the timeline row in the format of host year, ten years before and after and we also adding the announcing year as a time point to consider if announcing will influence their tourism expenditure. In this way, we can also deleted the labels in the original chart so that it will be much easy to compare these six countries. Since the data starts from 1995, so some of the countries like Japan and France may not be able to present the announcing year point data.

Now, from the revised version ,we can clearly see that Brazil is a little bit different, it has a boost at the host year but followed another rapid drop. vAccording to Wall Street Journal, Brazil tourists seen spending [$2.97 Billion](https://www.wsj.com/articles/brazil-tourists-seen-spending-2-97-billion-during-world-cup-1403010185) during World Cup and $50 Million in Rio de Janeiro during tournament's first weekend.  The total amount includes spending on hotels, transportation and at restaurants and bars, and Rio will attract more cash from tourists because it will host the most matches during the tournament, including the final. 

But for the post world cup years, what's going wrong then? Well firstly the expense of travelling to and within Brazil has been off putting to many, with Brazilians opting in droves to travel abroad with their overvalued Real and foreigners shunning Brazil for exactly the same reason. 

There is also the on-going perception that Brazil is a dangerous  country. However, an equally important problem seems to be a general lack of accurate, attractive and easily available information online in English and other  languages to independent travellers. This leaves even those who want to come to [Brazil](http://www.hiddenpousadasbrazil.com/brazil-blog/how-the-world-cup-might-still-support-a-sustainable-tourism-industry-in-brazil/) unsure about where to go, what to do and how to get around safely. 

#### <3> Tourists Ratio & Expenditure Ratio

[Revised-1 Tableau Link](https://public.tableau.com/profile/lipin.yuan#!/vizhome/HostCountryTouristExpenditureOverPopulationRatio/Sheet2?publish=yes) | [Revised-2 Tableau Link](https://public.tableau.com/profile/lipin.yuan#!/vizhome/HostCountryTouristExpenditureOverPopulationRatio_revised/Sheet1)|

In order to compare six countries using same criteria, we build two functions one is International Tourists over Population Ratio and another one is International Tourism Expenditure over Population Ratio.

Although the economic importance of tourism to a region is predominantly based on the proportion of value that tourism contributes to the total economy, [the ratio of visitors](https://www.tra.gov.au/tra/2016/Tourism_Region_Profiles/Region_profiles/index.html) compared to the permanent population of a region creates supplementary evidence of the level and impact of tourist density in individual tourism regions. 

Here are the two ratios we build:

**International Tourists Ratio** | **International Expenditure Ratio**
-------------  | ------------- 
![](https://github.com/lpyuan/AddPics/blob/master/Tourist_Ratio.png) | ![](https://github.com/lpyuan/AddPics/blob/master/Expenditure_Ratio.png) |

International Tourists Ratio means that the bigger the ratio, the more potential pressure will be for host country's social resources. And the International Tourism Expenditure Ratio represents potential gains from tourism on individual leveal. For example, if one hots country earns 20 million dollars for 1 million people, it can be interpreted that each person will potential get 20 dollars.

Compared to our first version, this is an additional part while we do our presentation, so we had two revised version charts. For the revised version one, we plot two ratios together for six countries in bar chart format and each ratio with an unified color, but in revised version two, we highlight three countries using different colors including Brazil, South Africa and France specifically to better present interesting insights from the chart. 

From the revised version two, we can see that for France, its tourists ratio are the highest of all the countries but with the lowest tourism expenditure ratio. It might tell that hosting World Cup brings too much tourists in short time period which could be overwhelmed for this country and also didn't get much gains from it. For Brazil and South Africa, the chart shows that this mega events also didin't generate much gains for potentially individual person. 


### 4. Limitations and Outlook:

+ Change the format to five years prior to the World Cup and compares that to the host year, as well as the five-year periods following.
+ Locating the year that FIFA announced the Host Country, compare the differences of post announcement years to post hosting years' impact on tourism.
