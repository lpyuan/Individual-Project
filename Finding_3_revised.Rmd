## 1. Project Introduction

Since the World Cup inauguration in Uruguay in 1930, over 20 countries have been hosts of this worldwide mega event. It is the everlasting hope of countries that host major sporting events that the games will bring about not only sporting glory but also an economic boom. Tourism is also a clear reason that world cup host country will get the benefit of tourists coming and spending money.

However, there are certain figures and metrics that suggest that the benefits might not outweigh the costs of hosting. If we want to assess the impacts a World Cup might have on a country, one way is to look at the historical experience of past hosts. 

So we used data of all host countries from three perspectives sports performance by comparison of World Cup Ranking to Elo Rating, economic impact by GDP growth rate and changes in current US dollars, international tourism impact by number of arrivals and expenditure. After our analysis, we found the following three unexpected findings.


## 2. Data Source and Wranging

The data used in this projects are generated mainly from the following public data sources:

+ Mass Shootings Data: [Gun Violence Archive](http://www.shootingtracker.com/)
+ Gun Law Strength Data: [The Giffords Law Center](http://lawcenter.giffords.org/scorecard/)
+ Multiple Cause of Death Data: [CDC](https://wonder.cdc.gov/mcd.html).
  *This data represented firearm caused death in each state each year, from 1999 to 2016.*
+ [Gun Ownership and Social Gun Culture Data](http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc4809774)

### Finding 3.1 How Big Are Home-court Advantages for Hosting Country on World Cup Ranking?

Since the beginning of the World Cup, host countries have produced a better performance compared to their Soccer Rating in the world every year apart from 1990. 

Our analysis shows that home country advantage is equivalent to progressing an additional two rounds on average, and this pattern is evident in Figure. This home region effect may reflect a mix of stronger home crowd support and common climatic conditions. A European country has never won a World Cup held in the Americas, while only once has a South American country won the World Cup in Europe (Brazil in 1958).

We used world [World Soccer Elo rating](https://www.eloratings.net), it’s based on the Elo rating system, developed by Dr. Arpad Elo. This system is used by FIDE, the international chess federation, to rate chess players. by adding a weighting for the kind of match, an adjustment for the home team advantage, and an adjustment for goal difference in the match result.

The ratings take into account all international "A" matches for which results could be found. International football data is primarily obtained from rsssf.com, theroonba.com, and soccer-db.info.

Ratings tend to converge on a team's true strength relative to its competitors after about 30 matches. Ratings for teams with fewer than 30 matches should be considered provisional.

The ratings are based on the following formulas:

#### Rn = Ro + K × (W - We)

Rn is the new rating, Ro is the old (pre-match) rating.
K is the weight constant for the tournament played:
60 for World Cup finals;
50 for continental championship finals and major intercontinental tournaments;
40 for World Cup and continental qualifiers and major tournaments;
30 for all other tournaments;
20 for friendly matches.

K is then adjusted for the goal difference in the game. It is increased by half if a game is won by two goals, by 3/4 if a game is won by three goals, and by 3/4 + (N-3)/8 if the game is won by four or more goals, where N is the goal difference.

W is the result of the game (1 for a win, 0.5 for a draw, and 0 for a loss).

We is the expected result (win expectancy), either from the chart or the following formula:

#### We = 1 / (10(-dr/400) + 1)

[dr](https://www.eloratings.net/about) equals the difference in ratings plus 100 points for a team playing at home.

We calculated the difference between world cup ranking and world ranking and plot our result into the following figure. The ranking differences between world ranking and world cup ranking for the host countries since 1930 has an average of 8.35. Besides of the number, we observed that the result is very unbalanced, some group of countries only changed in a small range, and other countries changed in a relatively broad range.

Based on the above analysis, we divided hosting courtiers into two groups: the first group includes the countries that were rated the top 10 countries by world ranking, another group includes all the countries outside of that top 10 realms.

The result is unexpected, for the top ten world ranking countries, their ranking difference is minimal, having an average of 1.33, however, for the rest of the countries, their ranking differences has an average of 18.875 difference.

At this point, we already had a partial conclusion that some countries have a significant high hosting advantage. To make our conclusion more convincible, instead of comparing their absolute ranking difference, we created a formula that could calculate the difficulty for those countries to achieve such higher rankings:

#### Difficulty = (World Ranking – World Cup Ranking) / World Cup Ranking

The objective of this formula is simple to understand: one country has a world ranking of 50, and it’s rank score increased to 40 in World Cup; another country has a world ranking of 11, and its rank score increased to 1 in World Cup. For those two countries, their score all increased 10, but the difficulty of the increase is different.  By using our formula, we can more precisely check which countries outperform the most.

Korea had outperformed the most during 2002 world cup.

For the group stage, Korea(27)* was in group D, with United States(21), Portugal(8), and Poland(34). Korea(27) beat Portugal(8) during the group stage period. During Knockout stage, Korea first beat Italy(7), then beat Spain(2).

The result looks impossible, the difficulty for a team to reach such achieve is extremely hard. Based on this result, in our future revised version, we will dig deeper, try to obtain the data for Korea soccer statistics before and after 2002, and try to reach a reasonable conclusion. 

*Number inside of the parenthesis represent that country’s Elo Ranking

## New Findings and Graphs

**Figure 1.4 Korean World Cup Match Win Rate**

[Tableau public link](https://public.tableau.com/profile/bochen.wang#!/vizhome/winraterank/Dashboard2)

We used the pie chart to plot out the result for Korean world cup win rate. As we can see from the graph, in history Korea only have a 10%-win rate with the top 10 world ranking opponents, and 19% win rate with rest the opponents. Both win rate is meager, so we can conclude that Korea will typically not considered as a strong soccer nation. 


**Figure 1.5 Korean Elo Score Vs. World Cup Score**

[Tableau public link](https://public.tableau.com/profile/bochen.wang#!/vizhome/KoreaEloScoreVsworldcupscore/Dashboard1)

We tracked additional data from FIFA world cup website and Elo world soccer rating system. Based on the previous analysis, we found out during 2002 world cup, Korea had outperformed the most. At this time, we focused on Korea and plotted out the Elo Score Vs. World Cup score for Korea from 1990 to 2014. As we can see from the graph, the Elo score and World Cup score have the same trending. The average differences between Elo Score and World Cup score are 14.5; However, during 2002 world cup, the difference is 23. After 2002, we can observe their soccer ranking is keep decreasing. We can conclude from the graph that Korean had a significant home advantage during the world cup 2002. After 2002 the world cup, Korean’s ranking is keeping decreasing, and even worse than before 2002's ranking. So the result from 2002 world cup not helpful for Korea to increase their national soccer performance. 

### Finding 3.2 

### Finding 3.3 - Does World Cup Really Bring Tourism Gains To Host Countries?

While many factors influence tourism growth, one of the more perceptible contributions e at least, in the public eye, comes from global events, or mega-events.

Mega-events, according to Roche (2000), are large-scale cultural (including commercial and sporting) events, which have a dramatic character, mass popular appeal and international significance. Obviously, FIFA World Cup is a precious opportunity for host countries to attract international tourists and increase their expenditure.

Firstly, according to one study, it is said that a very direct benefit of such mega-events on tourism is the increase of the number of tourists arrivals to the host country in the year of the event.

So we plot six host countries data of number of arrivals from 1995 to 2016. In this way, we can also measure the long-run impact on tourist arrivals, both before and after the event. For each country, we label out their host year with country name and the number of arrivals. 

For revised version, since we have two charts separately divided countries into two groups, so in Figure 1.1, we specifically highlight France (blue color) and Germany (orange color). Besides, we labeled their host year data for comparison. In this way, we changed the number of colors from six to two. Because after presentation, some of our audience suggested that multiple colors and labels may hide main information that we want to express.

Now from the revised chart above, we can more clearly see that the international tourists to France and Germany are obviously two biggest countries whose international tourists increase after hosting World Cup, especially in the following two years.  

In revised version of Figure 1.2, after we filter out France and Germany, we can have a better observation of other countries. Although South Africa and Japan is increasing, the growth rate is pretty small. It did not show an substantially arising trend around the host year. Meanwhile, I find that Brazil and Korea are two countries showing different decreasing trends from other two in the year after hosting World Cup.  This also help us to dig more on the reason why these two countries were negatively impacted. 

After our research, on general, maybe because 'regular' tourists change their behaviors when a mega-event is held, either shifting their trip to a different time or different location. This may result in reduced tourism gain, or even loss. For Brazil and Korea, because of their political scandal and cheating scandal, international media did much negative reports on these two countries and thus instead bring some damages to their national image which may harm their tourism.

As we cannot analysis many patterns of the number of international tourists, we tried to dig more in the following graph with the expenditure of international tourism.

#### <2> International Tourism Expenditures

[Revised Tableau Link](https://public.tableau.com/profile/lipin.yuan#!/vizhome/InternationalTourismExpenditure1995-2016_revised/Dashboard1?publish=yes)

From the aspect of tourism expenditure, when countries host global events, the assumption is often that the exposure and the tourism will massively boost. So far that does seem to be the case for Japan. But France, Germany, Korea and South Africa are all showing a very profitable growth.

In the original chart,since our data starts from 1995 to 2016, so we use time series data as rows and label their hosting data with annotation. But from this chart, we can only see each country’s trending and is not convenient to put these countries to the same time points.

For revised version, we changed the timeline row in the format of host year, ten years before and after and we also adding the announcing year as a time point to consider if announcing will influence their tourism expenditure. In this way, we can also deleted the labels in the original chart so that it will be much easy to compare these six countries. Since the data starts from 1995, so some of the countries like Japan and France may not be able to present the announcing year point data.

Now, from the revised version ,we can clearly see that Brazil is a little bit different, it has a boost at the host year but followed another rapid drop. vAccording to Wall Street Journal, Brazil tourists seen spending [$2.97 Billion](https://www.wsj.com/articles/brazil-tourists-seen-spending-2-97-billion-during-world-cup-1403010185) during World Cup and $50 Million in Rio de Janeiro during tournament's first weekend.  The total amount includes spending on hotels, transportation and at restaurants and bars, and Rio will attract more cash from tourists because it will host the most matches during the tournament, including the final. 

But for the post world cup years, what's going wrong then? Well firstly the expense of travelling to and within Brazil has been off putting to many, with Brazilians opting in droves to travel abroad with their overvalued Real and foreigners shunning Brazil for exactly the same reason. 

There is also the on-going perception that Brazil is a dangerous  country. However, an equally important problem seems to be a general lack of accurate, attractive and easily available information online in English and other  languages to independent travellers. This leaves even those who want to come to [Brazil](http://www.hiddenpousadasbrazil.com/brazil-blog/how-the-world-cup-might-still-support-a-sustainable-tourism-industry-in-brazil/) unsure about where to go, what to do and how to get around safely. 

#### <3> Tourists Ratio & Expenditure Ratio

**Figure 3:  Tourists & Expenditure Over Population Ratio**

[Revised-1 Tableau Link](https://public.tableau.com/profile/lipin.yuan#!/vizhome/HostCountryTouristExpenditureOverPopulationRatio/Sheet2?publish=yes) | [Revised-2 Tableau Link](https://public.tableau.com/profile/lipin.yuan#!/vizhome/HostCountryTouristExpenditureOverPopulationRatio_revised/Sheet1)|

In order to compare six countries using same criteria, we build two functions one is International Tourists over Population Ratio and another one is International Tourism Expenditure over Population Ratio.

Although the economic importance of tourism to a region is predominantly based on the proportion of value that tourism contributes to the total economy, [the ratio of visitors](https://www.tra.gov.au/tra/2016/Tourism_Region_Profiles/Region_profiles/index.html) compared to the permanent population of a region creates supplementary evidence of the level and impact of tourist density in individual tourism regions. 

Here are the two ratios we build:

**International Tourists Ratio** | **International Expenditure Ratio**
-------------  | ------------- 
![](https://github.com/lpyuan/AddPics/blob/master/Tourist_Ratio.png) | ![](https://github.com/lpyuan/AddPics/blob/master/Expenditure_Ratio.png) |

International Tourists Ratio means that the bigger the ratio, the more potential pressure will be for host country's social resources. And the International Tourism Expenditure Ratio represents potential gains from tourism on individual leveal. For example, if one hots country earns 20 million dollars for 1 million people, it can be interpreted that each person will potential get 20 dollars.

Compared to our first version, this is an additional part while we do our presentation, so we had two revised version charts. For the revised version one, we plot two ratios together for six countries in bar chart format and each ratio with an unified color, but in revised version two, we highlight three countries using different colors including Brazil, South Africa and France specifically to better present interesting insights from the chart. 

From the revised version two, we can see that for France, its tourists ratio are the highest of all the countries but with the lowest tourism expenditure ratio. It might tell that hosting World Cup brings too much tourists in short time period which could be overwhelmed for this country and also didn't get much gains from it. For Brazil and South Africa, the chart shows that this mega events also didin't generate much gains for potentially individual person. 


### 4. Limitations and Outlook:

+ Change the format to five years prior to the World Cup and compares that to the host year, as well as the five-year periods following.
+ Locating the year that FIFA announced the Host Country, compare the differences of post announcement years to post hosting years' impact on tourism.
