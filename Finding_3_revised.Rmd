## 1. Project Introduction

America is an exceptional country when it comes to guns. In this project, we will focus on this unique topic -  gun violence and explain interesting findings by data visualization.

Inspired by a Vox [article](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/10/2/16399418/us-gun-violence-statistics-maps-charts) titled "America's unique gun violence problem, explained in 17 maps and charts", we developed the following two data products including a redesign of existing data product and a deceptive data product. Comparing three versions of charts together, it indeed can sharpen our critical perspectives on data visualizations,logical reasoning about design decisions, and efforts on data visualization skiis improvement. 


## 2. Data Source and Wranging

The data used in this projects are generated mainly from the following public data sources:

+ Mass Shootings Data: [Gun Violence Archive](http://www.shootingtracker.com/)
+ Gun Law Strength Data: [The Giffords Law Center](http://lawcenter.giffords.org/scorecard/)
+ Multiple Cause of Death Data: [CDC](https://wonder.cdc.gov/mcd.html).
  *This data represented firearm caused death in each state each year, from 1999 to 2016.*
+ [Gun Ownership and Social Gun Culture Data](http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc4809774)

Here is the data clean and aggregation part in jupyter file:

### Finding 3 - Does World Cup Really Bring Tourism Gains To Host Countries?

While many factors influence tourism growth, one of the more perceptible contributions e at least, in the public eye, comes from global events, or mega-events.

Mega-events, according to Roche (2000), are large-scale cultural (including commercial and sporting) events, which have a dramatic character, mass popular appeal and international significance. Obviously, FIFA World Cup is a precious opportunity for host countries to attract international tourists and increase their expenditure.

Firstly, according to one study, it is said that a very direct benefit of such mega-events on tourism is the increase of the number of tourists arrivals to the host country in the year of the event.

So we plot six host countries data of number of arrivals from 1995 to 2016. In this way, we can also measure the long-run impact on tourist arrivals, both before and after the event. For each country, we label out their host year with country name and the number of arrivals. 

For revised version, since we have two charts separately divided countries into two groups, so in Figure 1.1, we specifically highlight France (blue color) and Germany (orange color). Besides, we labeled their host year data for comparison. In this way, we changed the number of colors from six to two. Because after presentation, some of our audience suggested that multiple colors and labels may hide main information that we want to express.

Now from the revised chart above, we can more clearly see that the international tourists to France and Germany are obviously two biggest countries whose international tourists increase after hosting World Cup, especially in the following two years.  

In revised version of Figure 1.2, after we filter out France and Germany, we can have a better observation of other countries. Although South Africa and Japan is increasing, the growth rate is pretty small. It did not show an substantially arising trend around the host year. Meanwhile, I find that Brazil and Korea are two countries showing different decreasing trends from other two in the year after hosting World Cup.  This also help us to dig more on the reason why these two countries were negatively impacted. 

After our research, on general, maybe because 'regular' tourists change their behaviors when a mega-event is held, either shifting their trip to a different time or different location. This may result in reduced tourism gain, or even loss. For Brazil and Korea, because of their political scandal and cheating scandal, international media did much negative reports on these two countries and thus instead bring some damages to their national image which may harm their tourism.

As we cannot analysis many patterns of the number of international tourists, we tried to dig more in the following graph with the expenditure of international tourism.

#### <2> International Tourism Expenditures

Form the aspect of tourism expenditure, when countries host global events, the assumption is often that the exposure and the tourism will massively boost. So far that does seem to be the case for Japan. But France, Germany, Korea and South Africa are all showing a very profitable growth.

Brazil is a little bit different, it has a boost at the host year but followed another rapid drop. vAccording to Wall Street Journal, Brazil tourists seen spending [$2.97 Billion](https://www.wsj.com/articles/brazil-tourists-seen-spending-2-97-billion-during-world-cup-1403010185) during World Cup and $50 Million in Rio de Janeiro during tournament's first weekend.  The total amount includes spending on hotels, transportation and at restaurants and bars, and Rio will attract more cash from tourists because it will host the most matches during the tournament, including the final. 

But for the post world cup years, what's going wrong then? Well firstly the expense of travelling to and within Brazil has been off putting to many, with Brazilians opting in droves to travel abroad with their overvalued Real and foreigners shunning Brazil for exactly the same reason. 

There is also the on-going perception that Brazil is a dangerous  country. However, an equally important problem seems to be a general lack of accurate, attractive and easily available information online in English and other  languages to independent travellers. This leaves even those who want to come to [Brazil](http://www.hiddenpousadasbrazil.com/brazil-blog/how-the-world-cup-might-still-support-a-sustainable-tourism-industry-in-brazil/) unsure about where to go, what to do and how to get around safely.

#### Limitations and Outlook:

+ Change the format to five years prior to the World Cup and compares that to the host year, as well as the five-year periods following.
+ Locating the year that FIFA announced the Host Country, compare the differences of post announcement years to post hosting years' impact on tourism.
