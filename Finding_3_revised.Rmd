## 1. Project Introduction

Since the World Cup inauguration in Uruguay in 1930, over 20 countries have been hosts of this worldwide mega event. It is the everlasting hope of countries that host major sporting events that the games will bring about not only sporting glory but also an economic boom. Tourism is also a clear reason that world cup host country will get the benefit of tourists coming and spending money.

However, there are certain figures and metrics that suggest that the benefits might not outweigh the costs of hosting. If we want to assess the impacts a World Cup might have on a country, one way is to look at the historical experience of past hosts. 

So we used data of all host countries from three perspectives sports performance by comparison of World Cup Ranking to Elo Rating, economic impact by GDP growth rate and changes in current US dollars, international tourism impact by number of arrivals and expenditure. After our analysis, we found the following three unexpected findings.

## 3. Revised Data Product

### Finding 3.1 How Big Are Home-court Advantages for Hosting Country on World Cup Ranking?

Since the beginning of the World Cup, host countries have produced a better performance compared to their Soccer Rating in the world every year apart from 1990. 

Our analysis shows that home country advantage is equivalent to progressing an additional two rounds on average, and this pattern is evident in Figure. This home region effect may reflect a mix of stronger home crowd support and common climatic conditions. A European country has never won a World Cup held in the Americas, while only once has a South American country won the World Cup in Europe (Brazil in 1958).

We used world [World Soccer Elo rating](https://www.eloratings.net), it’s based on the Elo rating system, developed by Dr. Arpad Elo. This system is used by FIDE, the international chess federation, to rate chess players. by adding a weighting for the kind of match, an adjustment for the home team advantage, and an adjustment for goal difference in the match result.

The ratings take into account all international "A" matches for which results could be found. International football data is primarily obtained from rsssf.com, theroonba.com, and soccer-db.info.

Ratings tend to converge on a team's true strength relative to its competitors after about 30 matches. Ratings for teams with fewer than 30 matches should be considered provisional.

The ratings are based on the following formulas:

#### Rn = Ro + K × (W - We)

Rn is the new rating, Ro is the old (pre-match) rating.
K is the weight constant for the tournament played:
60 for World Cup finals;
50 for continental championship finals and major intercontinental tournaments;
40 for World Cup and continental qualifiers and major tournaments;
30 for all other tournaments;
20 for friendly matches.

K is then adjusted for the goal difference in the game. It is increased by half if a game is won by two goals, by 3/4 if a game is won by three goals, and by 3/4 + (N-3)/8 if the game is won by four or more goals, where N is the goal difference.

W is the result of the game (1 for a win, 0.5 for a draw, and 0 for a loss).

We is the expected result (win expectancy), either from the chart or the following formula:

#### We = 1 / (10(-dr/400) + 1)

[dr](https://www.eloratings.net/about) equals the difference in ratings plus 100 points for a team playing at home.

We calculated the difference between world cup ranking and world ranking and plot our result into the following figure. The ranking differences between world ranking and world cup ranking for the host countries since 1930 has an average of 8.35. Besides of the number, we observed that the result is very unbalanced, some group of countries only changed in a small range, and other countries changed in a relatively broad range.

Based on the above analysis, we divided hosting courtiers into two groups: the first group includes the countries that were rated the top 10 countries by world ranking, another group includes all the countries outside of that top 10 realms.

The result is unexpected, for the top ten world ranking countries, their ranking difference is minimal, having an average of 1.33, however, for the rest of the countries, their ranking differences has an average of 18.875 difference.

At this point, we already had a partial conclusion that some countries have a significant high hosting advantage. To make our conclusion more convincible, instead of comparing their absolute ranking difference, we created a formula that could calculate the difficulty for those countries to achieve such higher rankings:

#### Difficulty = (World Ranking – World Cup Ranking) / World Cup Ranking

The objective of this formula is simple to understand: one country has a world ranking of 50, and it’s rank score increased to 40 in World Cup; another country has a world ranking of 11, and its rank score increased to 1 in World Cup. For those two countries, their score all increased 10, but the difficulty of the increase is different.  By using our formula, we can more precisely check which countries outperform the most.

Korea had outperformed the most during 2002 world cup.

For the group stage, Korea(27)* was in group D, with United States(21), Portugal(8), and Poland(34). Korea(27) beat Portugal(8) during the group stage period. During Knockout stage, Korea first beat Italy(7), then beat Spain(2).

The result looks impossible, the difficulty for a team to reach such achieve is extremely hard. Based on this result, in our future revised version, we will dig deeper, try to obtain the data for Korea soccer statistics before and after 2002, and try to reach a reasonable conclusion. 

*Number inside of the parenthesis represent that country’s Elo Ranking 

## New Findings and Graphs

**Figure 1.4 Korean World Cup Match Win Rate**
![](https://github.com/bochenw/picture/blob/master/Screen%20Shot%202018-06-14%20at%201.59.39%20PM.png)
[Tableau public link](https://public.tableau.com/profile/bochen.wang#!/vizhome/winraterank/Dashboard2)

We used the pie chart to plot out the result for Korean world cup win rate. As we can see from the graph, in history Korea only have a 10%-win rate with the top 10 world ranking opponents, and 19% win rate with rest the opponents. Both win rate is meager, so we can conclude that Korea will typically not considered as a strong soccer nation. 

**Figure 1.5 Korean Elo Score Vs. World Cup Score**
![](https://github.com/bochenw/picture/blob/master/Screen%20Shot%202018-06-14%20at%201.57.12%20PM.png)
[Tableau public link](https://public.tableau.com/profile/bochen.wang#!/vizhome/KoreaEloScoreVsworldcupscore/Dashboard1)

We tracked additional data from FIFA world cup website and Elo world soccer rating system. Based on the previous analysis, we found out during 2002 world cup, Korea had outperformed the most. At this time, we focused on Korea and plotted out the Elo Score Vs. World Cup score for Korea from 1990 to 2014. As we can see from the graph, the Elo score and World Cup score have the same trending. The average differences between Elo Score and World Cup score are 14.5; However, during 2002 world cup, the difference is 23. After 2002, we can observe their soccer ranking is keep decreasing. We can conclude from the graph that Korean had a significant home advantage during the world cup 2002. After 2002 the world cup, Korean’s ranking is keeping decreasing, and even worse than before 2002's ranking. So the result from 2002 world cup not helpful for Korea to increase their national soccer performance. 

### Finding 3.2 - Will World Cup Increase the GDP of Host Countries? Probably not!

World cup is not only about sports glory, it also influences the economy, in this finding, we'll focuses on the argument that whether world cup will lead an economic increase to the host countries.

We selected 13 countries of 14 world cup games since 1960, including Chile(1962), United Kingdom(1966), Mexico(1970), Germany(1974), Argentina(1978), Spain(1982), Mexico(1986), Italy(1990), United States(1994), France(1998), Korea(2002), Japan(2002), Germany(2006), South Africa(2010), Brazil(2014).

#### <1> Compare GDP Growth Rate of Host Countries

If the World Cup does provide an economic boost, we might expect to see an increase in the growth of a nation's gross domestic product (GDP) either in the World Cup year or in the immediate aftermath. But after the analysis, we found that hosting World Cup might be not very profitable!

**Figure 1: Average and Median Growth in Real Gross Domestic Product Host Countries (1960-2016)**

The below Figure 1 presents the growth rate of GDP in **the five years prior to the World Cup (Pre: Y-5 to Host Year) and compares that to the growth rate in the World Cup host year, as well as the five-year periods following (Post: Host year to Y5)**.

[Original Tableau public link]() | [Revised Tableau public link]() 

The graph shows the **average and the median growth rates** of all the host countries in five years prior to and the five years after the World Cup event. And this discussion could be interpreted as being suggestive of possible trends, not as conclusive evidence one way or the other about the causal impact of the World Cup on national economies.

It is interesting to find that on average, economic growth is slower in the host year than in the years both preceding and following. In other words, World Cup hosts have seen a negative impact on economic growth in the year of the event. With the World Cup games lasting about one month in total, the distraction of such a large sporting event might be enough to slow economic growth.

On the other hand, the data suggests that host countries might recover nicely in the two years immediately following the World Cup with average growth rates that are higher than the years immediately preceding it.

In the revised version, we removed the average line as its not informative, and remove the data point markd and change the color to make the graph more clear. So now we can clearly see the highlight of the host year and the growth is significantly slow.

#### <2> GDP Annual Changes in Current US$

**Figure 2.1: GDP Changes Among Host Countries (1960-2016)**

When we compared the GDP change in current $US, we can see the big differences among these host countries. Countries like the U.S., Germany and Japan are known as large economies, did show a rising trend after host year as we can see from the following graph.  

Original Chart | Revised Version 
-------------  | ------------- 
![](https://github.com/gleamingMushroom/AddImage/blob/master/GDP%20Change%20among%20large%20Economies.png) | ![](https://github.com/gleamingMushroom/AddImage/blob/master/GDP1.png)  
[Original Tableau public link]() | [Revised Tableau public link]() 

Germany (2006), France (1998) and the United States (1994), with developed infrastructure and modern stadiums, spent less than a billion each. When South Korea and Japan co-hosted in 2002 and built new facilities, South Korea spent [$2.5 billion](http://time.com/2930699/world-cup-brazil-spending/)and Japan [$5 billion](http://time.com/2930699/world-cup-brazil-spending/).But it's not obvious to draw conclusion for other countries.

In the revised version, according to the audience suggestions, we changed the color to highlight the lines we want to emphasis so it will be more straightforward, in this graph, we highlighted the large economies and will leave explanations of other countries to the next graph.

**Figure 2.2: GDP Changes Among Host Countries (Medium Economies, 1960-2016)** 
  
As the huge GDP gaps between countries, we cannot really see what happended to country with GDP below 2 trillons. So by filtering out large economies, we can see from the following graph, after host year, Brazil has a significant drop. Possible reasons could be: inflation, cost of [infrustration](http://money.cnn.com/2014/05/22/news/economy/world-cup-brazil/index.html), these are all possile reasons to cause negtive impact of GDP.

This World Cup of Brazil is actually the most expensive one yet, with estimates of Brazil's total expenditures hovering around $14 billion including more than $3.6 billion spent on 12 new and renovated stadiums. 

In the revised version, we change the color to highlight Brazil as it have an obvious opposite trend with others.

**Figure 2.3: GDP Changes among Host Countries (Small Economies, 1960-2016)**
  
There is an obvious economic boosting for South Africa, as the only country in Africa ever host the world cup, this event was seen as an African achievement. 

Also, it was a remarkable transition for the nation that had been banned from the global tournament by FIFA in 1961. South Africa was hoping that the opportunity to host the biggest spectacle in the world would be an opportunity to continue its societal transformation and economic development.(references: Economic and Social Impact of the World Cup on South Africa)

South Africa directly spent over 4 billion dollars to host the cup (Cohen 2010), and billions more in corresponding infrastructure improvements in host cities (Desal and Vahed 2010, 156). In all, the government spent over R13 billion on infrastructure and transportation improvements. This spending directly created 130,000 construction jobs (Marcus, 2010), and the World Cup as a whole indirectly resulted in a gain of 415,000 jobs (Sylvester and Harju 2010, 8).

[Original Tableau public link]() | [Revised Tableau public link]() 

In the revised version, we highlighted South Africa as it initially have an increase trend and start to drop one year after World Cup. So when we observe the graph, we wondered could this has anything to do with the cost? So we gathered information of the cost from news, and we can see for the big countries, the cost of GDP is very small, but for South Africa, they actually spent 1% of their GDP for the event, maybe this is why the GDP line for it is so fluctuated.

![](https://github.com/gleamingMushroom/AddImage/blob/master/costofgdp.png)  

South Africa directly spent over 4 billion dollars to host the cup (Cohen 2010), and billions more in corresponding infrastructure improvements in host cities (Desal and Vahed 2010, 156). Germany (2006), France (1998) and the United States (1994), with developed infrastructure and modern stadiums, spent less than a billion each. When South Korea and Japan co-hosted in 2002 and built new facilities, South Korea spent $2.5 billion and Japan $5 billion. 2010 World Cup in South Africa cost a total of $3.9 billion. The most expensive one is Brazil, with estimates of total expenditures hovering around $14 billion. 

### Finding 3.3 - Does World Cup Really Bring Tourism Gains To Host Countries?

While many factors influence tourism growth, one of the more perceptible contributions e at least, in the public eye, comes from global events, or mega-events.

Mega-events, according to Roche (2000), are large-scale cultural (including commercial and sporting) events, which have a dramatic character, mass popular appeal and international significance. Obviously, FIFA World Cup is a precious opportunity for host countries to attract international tourists and increase their expenditure.

#### <1> International Tourism Number of Arrivals

Firstly, according to one study, it is said that a very direct benefit of such mega-events on tourism is the increase of the number of tourists arrivals to the host country in the year of the event.

So we plot six host countries data of number of arrivals from 1995 to 2016. In this way, we can also measure the long-run impact on tourist arrivals, both before and after the event. For each country, we label out their host year with country name and the number of arrivals. 

For revised version, since we have two charts separately divided countries into two groups, so in Figure 1.1, we specifically highlight France (blue color) and Germany (orange color). Besides, we labeled their host year data for comparison. In this way, we changed the number of colors from six to two. Because after presentation, some of our audience suggested that multiple colors and labels may hide main information that we want to express.

Now from the revised chart above, we can more clearly see that the international tourists to France and Germany are obviously two biggest countries whose international tourists increase after hosting World Cup, especially in the following two years.  

In revised version of Figure 1.2, after we filter out France and Germany, we can have a better observation of other countries. Although South Africa and Japan is increasing, the growth rate is pretty small. It did not show an substantially arising trend around the host year. Meanwhile, I find that Brazil and Korea are two countries showing different decreasing trends from other two in the year after hosting World Cup.  This also help us to dig more on the reason why these two countries were negatively impacted. 

After our research, on general, maybe because 'regular' tourists change their behaviors when a mega-event is held, either shifting their trip to a different time or different location. This may result in reduced tourism gain, or even loss. For Brazil and Korea, because of their political scandal and cheating scandal, international media did much negative reports on these two countries and thus instead bring some damages to their national image which may harm their tourism.

As we cannot analysis many patterns of the number of international tourists, we tried to dig more in the following graph with the expenditure of international tourism.

#### <2> International Tourism Expenditures

**Figure 2:  International Tourism Expenditures**

[Original Tableau Link](https://us-west-2b.online.tableau.com/#/site/yezhuli/views/Book1/Internationaltourismexpenditures?:iid=5)

Revised Version|

![](https://github.com/lpyuan/AddPics/blob/master/TourismExpenditure.png) |
[Revised Tableau Link](https://public.tableau.com/profile/lipin.yuan#!/vizhome/InternationalTourismExpenditure1995-2016_revised/Dashboard1?publish=yes)

From the aspect of tourism expenditure, when countries host global events, the assumption is often that the exposure and the tourism will massively boost. So far that does seem to be the case for Japan. But France, Germany, Korea and South Africa are all showing a very profitable growth.

In the original chart,since our data starts from 1995 to 2016, so we use time series data as rows and label their hosting data with annotation. But from this chart, we can only see each country’s trending and is not convenient to put these countries to the same time points.

For revised version, we changed the timeline row in the format of host year, ten years before and after and we also adding the announcing year as a time point to consider if announcing will influence their tourism expenditure. In this way, we can also deleted the labels in the original chart so that it will be much easy to compare these six countries. Since the data starts from 1995, so some of the countries like Japan and France may not be able to present the announcing year point data.

Now, from the revised version ,we can clearly see that Brazil is a little bit different, it has a boost at the host year but followed another rapid drop. vAccording to Wall Street Journal, Brazil tourists seen spending [$2.97 Billion](https://www.wsj.com/articles/brazil-tourists-seen-spending-2-97-billion-during-world-cup-1403010185) during World Cup and $50 Million in Rio de Janeiro during tournament's first weekend.  The total amount includes spending on hotels, transportation and at restaurants and bars, and Rio will attract more cash from tourists because it will host the most matches during the tournament, including the final. 

But for the post world cup years, what's going wrong then? Well firstly the expense of travelling to and within Brazil has been off putting to many, with Brazilians opting in droves to travel abroad with their overvalued Real and foreigners shunning Brazil for exactly the same reason. 

There is also the on-going perception that Brazil is a dangerous  country. However, an equally important problem seems to be a general lack of accurate, attractive and easily available information online in English and other  languages to independent travellers. This leaves even those who want to come to [Brazil](http://www.hiddenpousadasbrazil.com/brazil-blog/how-the-world-cup-might-still-support-a-sustainable-tourism-industry-in-brazil/) unsure about where to go, what to do and how to get around safely. 

#### <3> Tourists Ratio & Expenditure Ratio

**Figure 3:  Tourists & Expenditure Over Population Ratio** 

Revised Chart-1 | Revised Chart-2 
-------------  | ------------- 
![](https://github.com/lpyuan/AddPics/blob/master/Ratio_change.png) | ![](https://github.com/lpyuan/AddPics/blob/master/Ratio.png)|
[Revised-1 Tableau Link](https://public.tableau.com/profile/lipin.yuan#!/vizhome/HostCountryTouristExpenditureOverPopulationRatio/Sheet2?publish=yes) | [Revised-2 Tableau Link](https://public.tableau.com/profile/lipin.yuan#!/vizhome/HostCountryTouristExpenditureOverPopulationRatio_revised/Sheet1)|

In order to compare six countries using same criteria, we build two functions one is International Tourists over Population Ratio and another one is International Tourism Expenditure over Population Ratio.

Although the economic importance of tourism to a region is predominantly based on the proportion of value that tourism contributes to the total economy, [the ratio of visitors](https://www.tra.gov.au/tra/2016/Tourism_Region_Profiles/Region_profiles/index.html) compared to the permanent population of a region creates supplementary evidence of the level and impact of tourist density in individual tourism regions. 

Here are the two ratios we build:

**International Tourists Ratio** | **International Expenditure Ratio**
-------------  | ------------- 
![](https://github.com/lpyuan/AddPics/blob/master/Tourist_Ratio.png) | ![](https://github.com/lpyuan/AddPics/blob/master/Expenditure_Ratio.png) |

International Tourists Ratio means that the bigger the ratio, the more potential pressure will be for host country's social resources. And the International Tourism Expenditure Ratio represents potential gains from tourism on individual leveal. For example, if one hots country earns 20 million dollars for 1 million people, it can be interpreted that each person will potential get 20 dollars.

Compared to our first version, this is an additional part while we do our presentation, so we had two revised version charts. For the revised version one, we plot two ratios together for six countries in bar chart format and each ratio with an unified color, but in revised version two, we highlight three countries using different colors including Brazil, South Africa and France specifically to better present interesting insights from the chart. 

From the revised version two, we can see that for France, its tourists ratio are the highest of all the countries but with the lowest tourism expenditure ratio. It might tell that hosting World Cup brings too much tourists in short time period which could be overwhelmed for this country and also didn't get much gains from it. For Brazil and South Africa, the chart shows that this mega events also didin't generate much gains for potentially individual person. 


### 4. Limitations and Outlook:

+ As stated above, drawing general conclusion from GDP data is very difficult. Different nations have had a variety of experiences, so the discussion above should be interpreted as being suggestive of possible trends, not as conclusive evidence one way or the other about the causal impact of the World Cup on national economies.

+ While some our data time limitations, some of our countries could not present all the data points for comparison, so in the future, we may have to find different indicators to explain the imact of World Cup.

+ Since the topic is pretty general, we just choose three important perspectives and some of our findings are showing the potential trends and might not be able to explain all the possible impacts.

+ As popularity of the sport has increased worldwide, we might expect a changing impact of the World Cup on economies, so the past is not necessarily a good guide for the future. (With over 4 billion followers of football, it is by far the most popular sport in the world. [Reference](https://www.totalsportek.com/most-popular-sports/)
