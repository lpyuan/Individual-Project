### 1. Intro

Data visualizations do a fantastic job of explaining data in a clear and engaging way. However, one [study](https://medium.com/@Infogram/study-asks-how-deceptive-are-deceptive-visualizations-8ff52fd81239) by New York University shows that if we design the graphical information with or without an intent to deceive, that may create a belief about the message and/or its components, which varies from the actual message.

And there are some common distortion techniques can lead to major misinterpretation, for example using truncated axis, aspect ratio or area as auantity for message exaggeration, and inverted axis to reverse message. 

So if we try visualize some of the charts in the [america gun violence](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/10/2/16399418/us-gun-violence-statistics-maps-charts) aricle by Vox in a deceptive way, it may lead to major misinterpretation from the readerâ€™s side and make opposite conclusions from the original one.

### 2. Data Wrangling 

Here is the data clean and aggregation part in jupyter file:

### 3. Deceptive Findings 

From the seventeen charts listed in the article, I chose three of them and used different data distortion techniques including inversted Y-axis, truncted X-axis and improper scaling presenting the data in an opposite way.

#### 3.1 States with more guns have more gun deaths?

Data Source: [Gun ownership and social gun culture](http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc4809774)

From the original chart on the left, the article illustrates that states with more guns tend to have far more gun deaths, including homicides and suicides, though there are several outliers. And the increasing trending line also seems t to strenghthen this opinion. 

But when we invert the rate of death per 10,000, the chart would be presented in an opposite way,which is exactly on the right. Using the same data in 2013 from a study in Injury Prevention and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention(CDC), the trending line become downward but actually represents increasing. If readers still explain this chart from a normal understanding of axis meaning, then it might mislead the conclusion to be *"more gunownership, less death rate"*.

#### 3.2 Gun homicides have declined over the past couple decades?

The article argued that gun homicides have declined over the past couple decades. And from the original chart on the left, we can see from 1981 to 2010, the rate of firearm homicide deaths indeed has two sudden decreases. It also shows the decreasing trend, especially the maximum value around 1993 was 7.0, but in 2010 this value became the minimum 3.6. 

But if we only choose the data from 1999 to 2010 and also add some recent years data,the result can be completely different. Just as the deceptive chart shows, it seems that gun homicides (like all homicides) keep stable for years and even starts increasing from 2014 to 2016. Because we manipulated the starting data point and only present the stable period, then the conclusion became totally opposite by the truncated axis visual distortion.

#### 3.3 Most gun deaths are not suicides?

Original Chart | Deceptive Chart
-------------  | -------------
![](https://github.com/lpyuan/AddPics/blob/master/firearm_suicide_homicide.png)|![](https://github.com/lpyuan/AddPics/blob/master/Firearm_suicide.png)

[Tableau Public Link](https://public.tableau.com/profile/lipin.yuan#!/vizhome/FirearmSuicidevs_Homicide_2/Sheet2?publish=yes)

Data Source:[CDC Multiple Cause of Death Data](https://wonder.cdc.gov/mcd.html)

The author held the opinion that the majority of gun-related deaths in the US are suicides. And from the original graph we can obviously see that the darker color line representing suicide is on the upper part for the whole period and ended with a big increase than the homicide line.

While if we use a distorted area chart instead of lines together with a truncted Y-axis, then it could be visually deceptive and might mislead readers to make the conclusion that the firearm homicides are more than suicides. Because the deceptive chart started the death number from 15k, which intentionally dimished the suicide area size with an improper scaling. And when we just compared the area size of these two, the visual effect would lead to a mistake.

### 4. Road Map

For future enhancement, I think it will better sharpen my kills to try different deception techniques like misusing the dual-axis,omitting data and ignoring conventions. In this way, I can have a full understanding of what deceptive visualizations are and how much of an impact they can have. Then it will remind me of avoding making these mistakes in the future.
